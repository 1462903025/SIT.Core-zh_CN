## About

The Stay in Tarkov project was born due to Battlestate Games' (BSG) reluctance to create the pure PvE version of Escape from Tarkov. 
The project's aim is simple, create a Cooperation PvE experience that retains progression. If BSG decide to create the ability to do this on live, this project will be shut down immediately.
